## Project Overview

This project explores the key factors influencing student academic performance using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the [Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the goal is to build predictive models and uncover hidden patterns in students academic behavior, background, and help bulding support systems.

## Problem Statement

Educational success is often assessed only by grades, without fully accounting for the various social, psychological, and environmental factors that may influence student performance. Traditional methods of evaluation fail to uncover the underlying contributors to academic success or failure.

This project addresses the following questions:
- What are the key academic and non-academic features that influence student performance?
- Can we predict final exam grades based on these features using machine learning?
- How can the insights gained be used to improve educational support and intervention?

The goal is to develop an accurate and interpretable prediction model that helps educators identify at-risk students and the root causes of their struggles.
