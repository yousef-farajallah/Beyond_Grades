## Project Overview

This project explores the key factors influencing student academic performance using machine learning techniques. Leveraging the [Student Performance dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, the goal is to build predictive models and uncover hidden patterns in students’ academic behavior, background, and help bulding support systems.
