## Project Methodology

This project follows a structured machine learning pipeline to analyze the factors affecting student performance and build predictive models. The steps are as follows:

1. **Problem Definition**
   - Objective: Predict student final grades and identify key influencing factors.
   - Type: Supervised regression problem.

2. **Data Collection**
   - Dataset: [Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
   - Includes demographic, social, and academic attributes of students.

3. **Data Understanding & Exploration**
   - Analyzed data structure, variable types, missing values, and basic statistics.
   - Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and correlations using visualizations.

4. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, scaled numerical features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
   - Engineered new features where appropriate.

5. **Model Building**
   - Trained multiple regression models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor, etc.
   - Evaluated each model using metrics: MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.

6. **Model Evaluation & Tuning**
   - Visualized model predictions and residuals.
   - Performed hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV for Random Forest) to improve model performance.

7. **Model Comparison**
   - Compared performance across all models using a summary table and visualizations.

8. **Conclusion & Insights**
   - Identified which features most strongly impact student performance.
   - Selected the most effective model for predicting student grades.

9. **Future Work**
   - Recommendations for dataset expansion, deployment, and integration into educational tools.
